# Introduction to coding with BBC Micro:bit

Many thanks from Paul and Kaisar for the opportunity to share the programming activities with such an enthusiastic set of children who impressed us with how much they achieved. 
We thought it would be helpful to provide this information sheet describing what we did for anyone who wants to explore this further. We used a few things:

## BBC Micro:bit 

A small computer board which can run programs, and has built-in inputs (including buttons and motion and orientation sensors) and has a display of LEDS which can show letters, numbers and pictures.

## Grove Inventor Kit

A box of extra sensors including the light sensor, Neopixel lightstrip and an interface board to connect them to the Micro:bit.

## Makecode

The free online Microsoft "Makecode" programming environment which allows you to write computer code using blocks
makecode.microbit.org

## Starter projects

Our own instructions for 8 quick projects to get you going.

It is then down to the child's creativity and enthusiasm to explore what is possible by taking these ideas further by programming the Micro:bit and attaching sensors and displays.
